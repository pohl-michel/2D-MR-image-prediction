This repository contains code performing the following:
1. time series forecasting
2. video forecasting

Specifically, various methods for online learning of recurrent neural networks (RNN) are used to execute the two tasks above:
 - real-time recurrent learning (RTRL)
 - [unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05043)
 - [sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07232)
 - [decoupled neural interfaces (DNI)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/jaderberg17a.html)

We invite the readers interested specifically in time series forecasting to refer to the README.md file located in the "Time_series_forecasting" folder as the current file focus mostly on video forecasting for brevity.

Left: ground-truth / right: predicted image 6 time steps in advance using SnAp-1. Other video forecasting results can be found in the "/Image_prediction/visualization" folder.

Video forecasting is executed by performing the following steps in order:
1. estimation of the "push" deformation vector field ${\vec{u}(\vec{x}, t_n)}$ between the image at time $t_1$ and $t_n$ for all indices $n$.
2. projection of ${\vec{u}(\vec{x}, t_n)}$ onto principal deformation vector fields (the principal components) ${\vec{u}_i(\vec{x})}$. The coordinates of that projection are the time-dependent weights $w_i(t)$.
3. prediction of the weights $w_i(t)$ using various methods including the RNN learning algorithms mentioned above.
4. warping forward the image at time $t_1$ using the deformation field reconstructed using the predicted weights $w_i(t+h)$ where $h$ is the prediction horizon.

The examples given correspond to respiratory motion forecasting: external marker position prediction for the first application, and 2D magnetic resonance chest image sequence prediction for the second application. However, the code is general and could be applied to the prediction of time series and (simple) videos in general.

Please consider citing these articles if you use this code in your research.

The repository is split into two different folders:
 - "Time series_forecasting" contains scripts and functions that perform time series forecasting. It is essentially self-contained / independent, and is an extension of the repository https://github.com/pohl-michel/time-series-forecasting-with-UORO-RTRL-LMS-and-linear-regression associated with [our former research article](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.01100). cf the readme file within that folder for more details.
 - "Image_prediction" contains scripts and functions that perform video forecasting. Those call functions from the former folder, that are used to predict $w_i(t)$ (step 3 above), which is the (low-dimensional) compressed representation of motion within these videos.

The main script performing image prediction is "image_prediction_main.m". The behavior of "image_prediction_main.m" is controlled by "load_impred_behavior_parameters.m" and essentially has two modes:
 1. optimization of the number of principal components and hyperparameters associated with the forecasting methods (corresponding to "beh_par.OPTIMIZE_NB_PCA_CP = true" in "load_impred_behavior_parameters.m"). Parallel computations are performed (which requires the parallel computing toolbox). In case one does not have access to the parallel computing toolbox, one can still run the script by replacing the "parfor" loops by "for" loops.
 2. inference with given prediction parameters (corresponding to "beh_par.OPTIMIZE_NB_PCA_CP = false" in "load_impred_behavior_parameters.m")

The parameters corresponding to image prediction can be modified in the following .m files:
 - Image_prediction/load_warp_par.m : file containing the parameters related to image warping.
 - Image_prediction/image_prediction_main.m : the variables "pred_meths" and "br_model_par.nb_pca_cp_tab" contain the prediction methods used and the number of principal components for inference (or the maximum number of principal comopnents when doing hyper-parameter optimisation), respectively. The input sequence names are specified in the "input_im_dir_suffix_tab" variable.
 - Time_series_forecasting/load_pred_par.m : file containing time-series forecasting parameters. It loads the "pred_par.xlsx" file in each sequence directory and parameters in those files can also be modified.
 - Time_series_forecasting/load_hyperpar_cv_info.m : file containing the range of hyper-parameters used for cross-validation.

The input images loaded by "image_prediction_main.m" are located in the "input_imgs/2D images" directory. The directory corresponding to each image sequence contain several files, among which:
 - pred_par.xlsx : contains parameter values related to low-dimensional representation forecasting
 - OF_calc_par.xlsx : contains optical flow computation parameters
 - disp_par.xlsx : contains parameters related to the display of images or figures 
 - im_seq_par.xlsx : contains parameters related to the input image seuqnece itself (image dimensions, number of images...)

The implementation of the pyramidal and iterative Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm for 2D images in this repository is an adaptation of that for 3D images in the following repository: https://github.com/pohl-michel/Lucas-Kanade-pyramidal-optical-flow-for-3D-image-sequences. The script "OF2D_param_optim_main.m" optimizes the parameters associated with deformation vector field computation using that algorithm. The parameter grid is specified in the file "load_OF_hyperparameters.m". One can also compute the optical flow for a given set of parameters using "image_prediction_main.m". The complete description of the registration algorithm can be found in the following article:

The cine-MR sequences in the "Image_prediction/input_imgs" folder come originally from a public dataset from ETH ZÃ¼rich publicly accessible online: [4D MRI lung data](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/research/datasets.html).
We selected 2 sagittal cross-sections for each of the 4D sequences, resampled them so that the resolution becomes 1mm*1mm per pixel, and shifted them so that the first image corresponds to the middle of expiration. Please cite the following article if you use that data in your work: "Boye, D. et al. - Population based modeling of respiratory lung motion and prediction from partial information - Proc.
